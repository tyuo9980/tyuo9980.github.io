					Geometry Wars
				</h2>

				<p>
					This was the project that made me commit to pursuing a career in software development. <br>
					Geometry wars was made as my final summative for grade 10 computer science, coded in Turing. It was my first major project and I tried to challenge myself. I loved to play Geometry Wars, especially pasifism so I decided to create a clone. The game was simple, a bunch of enemies home in on you and you try to pass through gates that spawn around the map. Upon passing through a gate, an explosion will kill all enemies within a certain radius and you rack up points. More and more enemies will spawn as time passes, so this was basically a survival game mode.
				</p>
				<p>
					I only knew basic collision detection between two objects at that time, so trying to figure out the collision algorithm for the enemies to not overlap as they follow you was my challenge. After three nights of testing with different ideas, I finally hit the jackpot. Everything worked beautifully and a rush of euphorism spread through my body. It was at that moment when I decided what I wanted to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					It turned out that my 50 lines of code simplified into 10 lines, since I later found out that it was basically circle collision.
